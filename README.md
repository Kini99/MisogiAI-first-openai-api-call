# First OpenAI API Call

This project demonstrates a basic usage of the OpenAI API using Python. It sends a user-provided prompt to OpenAI's GPT model and prints the assistant's response along with token usage.

## 📌 What the Script Does

- Takes a user prompt via console input.
- Uses a fixed system prompt to set the assistant's behavior.
- Sends both prompts to OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
- Prints the assistant’s reply and total tokens used in the response.
